# Ditching Excel for Python
Functionalities in Excel translated to Python.

The very first thought of creating this tutorial came into existence when I exhausted many hours online trying to search for one stop shop to replicate the most common functions in Excel using Pandas and Numpy. Though there are many tutorials/articles/blogs but then I had to traverse between multiple tabs, so to avoid wasting my time moving between tabs and there might be atleast one person like who's searching for the same I thought of creating this tutorial.

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Excel as input and output only rest all Excel tasks will be carried out using Python libraries: Pandas and Numpy

This is not the best for sure but should help to start your journey, I am working on another exhaustive one, which should be out soon.

Happy Learning!


If at all my tutorial helped you, would you buy me a Ko-fi!
